    # GENERIC OPTIONS

    # Debugging options
    # Uncomment to get the desired debugging behaviour.
    # Note that in some cases stderr debugging will not be as
    # verbose as syslog debugging due to internal limitations.
    #

    # antispam_debug_target = stderr
    # antispam_verbose_debug = 1

    # backend selection, MUST be configured first,
    # there's no default so you need to set one of
    # these options:
    # antispam_backend = crm114
    # antispam_backend = dspam
    # antispam_backend = pipe
    # antispam_backend = spool2dir

    # mail signature (used with any backend requiring a signature)

    # The list of folders for trash, spam and unsure can be given
    # with three options, e.g. "trash" matches the given folders
    # exactly as written, "trash_pattern" accept the * wildcard at
    # the end of the foldername, "trash_pattern_ignorecase"
    # accepts the * wildcard at the end of the foldername _and_
    # matches the name case insensitivly.

    # the *-wildcard with the following meaning:
    #    * at the end: any folder that _start_ with the string
    # e.g.:
    #   antispam_trash_pattern = deleted *;Gel&APY-schte *
    # match any folders that start with "deleted " or "GelÃ¶schte "
    # match is _case_senstive_!
    #
    #   antispam_trash_pattern_ignorecase = deleted *;Gel&APY-schte *
    # match any folders that start with "deleted " or "gelÃ¶schte "
    # match is _case_insenstive_, except the non-USASCII letters,
    # "Ã¶" in this example.
    # To match the upper-case Ã–, too, you need to add yet another
    # pattern "gel&ANY-schte *", note the different UTF7 encoding:
    # &ANY- instead of &APY-.

    #=====================
    # pipe plugin
    #
    # This plug can be used to train via an arbitrary program that
    # receives the message on standard input. Since sendmail can be
    # such a program, it can be used to send the message to another
    # email address for training there.
    #
    # For example:
    #   antispam_pipe_program = /path/to/mailtrain
    #        (defaults to /usr/sbin/sendmail)
    #   antispam_pipe_program_args = --for;%u
    #   antispam_pipe_program_spam_arg = --spam
    #   antispam_pipe_program_notspam_arg = --ham
    #   antispam_pipe_tmpdir = /tmp
    # will call it, for example, like this:
    #   /path/to/mailtrain --for jberg --spam
    #
    # The old configuration options from when this plugin was called
    # "mailtrain" are still valid, these are, in the same order as
    # above: antispam_mail_sendmail, antispam_mail_sendmail_args,
    # antispam_mail_spam, antispam_mail_notspam and antispam_mail_tmpdir.
    #
    # Alternatively, if you need to give multiple options, you can use
    # the spam_args/notspam_args parameters (which are used in preference
    # of the singular form):
    #   antispam_pipe_program_spam_args = --spam;--my-other-param1
    #   antispam_pipe_program_notspam_args = --ham;--my-other-param2
    # which will then call
    #   /path/to/mailtrain --for jberg --spam --my-other-param1

    # temporary directory
    antispam_pipe_tmpdir = /tmp

    # spam/not-spam argument (default unset which will is not what you want)
